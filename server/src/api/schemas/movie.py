Schemas for Movie API

This module contains the pydantic models for the Movie API.

The Movie model contains the basic information about a movie, such as its ID, original title, overview, poster path, average rating, and total number of users who have rated the movie.

The MovieDetail model extends the Movie model and adds fields for the genres, actors, and directors of the movie.
